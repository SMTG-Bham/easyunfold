## MgO defect cell

This folder contains an example of perform band unfolding of a supercell containing a single oxygen vacancy defect in 2+ charge state.

The defect in the middle of the band gap can be seed in the unfolded effective band structure. 

Using atomic projection, we can identify the defect level as a mixture of the Mg and O states, which is similar to that of the conduction band minimum.
However, the flatness of the defect level suggests that the defect state is localised.
