  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

	abstract = {I-V-{VI}2 ternary chalcogenides are gaining attention as earth-abundant, nontoxic, and air-stable absorbers for photovoltaic applications. However, the semiconductors explored thus far have slowly-rising absorption onsets, and their charge-carrier transport is not well understood yet. Herein, we investigate cation-disordered {NaBiS}2 nanocrystals, which have a steep absorption onset, with absorption coefficients reaching {\textgreater}105 cm−1 just above its pseudo-direct bandgap of 1.4 {eV}. Surprisingly, we also observe an ultrafast (picosecond-time scale) photoconductivity decay and long-lived charge-carrier population persisting for over one microsecond in {NaBiS}2 nanocrystals. These unusual features arise because of the localised, non-bonding S p character of the upper valence band, which leads to a high density of electronic states at the band edges, ultrafast localisation of spatially-separated electrons and holes, as well as the slow decay of trapped holes. This work reveals the critical role of cation disorder in these systems on both absorption characteristics and charge-carrier kinetics.},

	abstract = {Strong optical absorption by a semiconductor is a highly desirable property for many optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. The optimal thickness of a semiconductor absorber is primarily determined by its absorption coefficient. To date, this parameter has been considered as a fundamental material property, and efforts to realize thinner photovoltaics have relied on light-trapping structures that add complexity and cost. Here we demonstrate that engineering cation disorder in a ternary chalcogenide semiconductor leads to considerable absorption increase due to enhancement of the optical transition matrix elements. We show that cation-disorder-engineered {AgBiS}2 colloidal nanocrystals offer an absorption coefficient that is higher than other photovoltaic materials, enabling highly efficient extremely thin absorber photovoltaic devices. We report solution-processed, environmentally friendly, 30-nm-thick solar cells with short-circuit current density of 27 {mA} cm−2, a power conversion efficiency of 9.17\% (8.85\% certified) and high stability under ambient conditions.},
