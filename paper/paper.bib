  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

	abstract = {I-V-{VI}2 ternary chalcogenides are gaining attention as earth-abundant, nontoxic, and air-stable absorbers for photovoltaic applications. However, the semiconductors explored thus far have slowly-rising absorption onsets, and their charge-carrier transport is not well understood yet. Herein, we investigate cation-disordered {NaBiS}2 nanocrystals, which have a steep absorption onset, with absorption coefficients reaching {\textgreater}105 cm−1 just above its pseudo-direct bandgap of 1.4 {eV}. Surprisingly, we also observe an ultrafast (picosecond-time scale) photoconductivity decay and long-lived charge-carrier population persisting for over one microsecond in {NaBiS}2 nanocrystals. These unusual features arise because of the localised, non-bonding S p character of the upper valence band, which leads to a high density of electronic states at the band edges, ultrafast localisation of spatially-separated electrons and holes, as well as the slow decay of trapped holes. This work reveals the critical role of cation disorder in these systems on both absorption characteristics and charge-carrier kinetics.},

	abstract = {Lead toxicity and poor stability under operating conditions are major drawbacks that impede the widespread commercialization of metal–halide perovskite solar cells. Ti(IV) has been considered as an alternative species to replace Pb(II) because it is relatively nontoxic and abundant and its perovskite-like compounds have demonstrated promising performance when applied in solar cells (η {\textgreater} 3\%), photocatalysts, and nonlinear optical applications. Yet, Ti(IV) perovskites show instability in air, hindering their use. On the other hand, Sn(IV) has a similar cationic radius to Ti(IV), adopting the same vacancy-ordered double perovskite (VODP) structure and showing good stability in ambient conditions. We report here a combined experimental and computational study on mixed titanium–tin bromide and iodide VODPs, motivated by the hypothesis that these mixtures may show a stability higher than that of the pure titanium compositions. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the cations are highly miscible in these vacancy-ordered structures. Experimentally, we synthesized mixed titanium–tin VODPs as nanocrystals across the entire mixing range x (Cs2Ti1–xSnxX6; X = I or Br), using a colloidal synthetic approach. Analysis of the experimental and computed absorption spectra reveals weak hybridization and interactions between Sn and Ti octahedra with the alloy absorption being essentially a linear combination of the pure Sn and Ti compositions. These compounds are stabilized at high percentages of Sn (x of ∼60\%), as expected, with bromide compositions demonstrating greater stability compared to the iodides. Overall, we find that these materials behave akin to molecular aggregates, with the thermodynamic and optoelectronic properties governed by the intraoctahedral interactions.},

For instance, point defects participate in electronic (e.g. carrier generation and recombination) and optical (e.g. absorption and emission) processes critical to solar energy conversion. Solid-state diffusion, mediated by the transport of charged defects, is used for electrochemical energy storage. First-principles calculations of defects based on density functional theory have been widely used to complement, and even validate, experimental observations. In this ‘quick-start guide’, we discuss the best practice in how to calculate the formation energy of point defects in crystalline materials and analysis techniques appropriate to probe changes in structure and properties relevant across energy technologies.}

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.}
