# Code for unfolding bands

This package is intended for unfolding kpoints, it is based on [PyVaspwfc](https://github.com/QijingZheng/Vaspeasyunfolding) and contains the code of the latter.

NOTE: This package is under a MIT license, while the original PyVaspwfc code does not specific a license.

Changes made so far:

1. Adapt a more pythonic package structure - no longer putting modules at top levle
2. Include symmetry averaging of the kpoints to take account of symmetry broken supercell, which was ignored in the original `PyVaspwfc` code.
3. The origin `PyVaspwfc` code is included as an internal sub package


TODO

- [ ] Add serialization interface
- [ ] Add function to read and save spectral weights - so WAVECAR can be deleted once calculation is done
- [ ] Allow `UnfoldKSet` to be serialized to/loaded from the disk
- [ ] Make a CLI or phonopy-like interface
- [ ] Clean up, no need to include all of the `PyVaspwfc`, only the relavant WAVECAR reading the spectral weight calculation parts are needed.

## Effect of symmetry breaking and sampling additional kpoints

Test case - Si 2x2x2 cell.
The first atom is displaced by 0.2 A in the `[111]` direction.
This reduce the number of symmetry operations from 48 to 6.
Hence, additional kpoints need to be sampled for the pathway generated assuming a perfect primitive cell with the original symmetry.

Unfolded band structure of the perfect 2x2x2 supercell:

Comparing unfolds of the deformed 2x2x2 supercell, with and without extra kpoints.

![Deformed with and without additional paths](./examples/unfold-symmetry/Si_super_avg_SF_deformed_compared_resized.png)

Note that an extra branch along `\Gamma` to  `L` emerges, which is absent if no additional kpoint is performed.

While extra kpoints are needed in the symmetry-broken supercell, the remaining symmetry can be used to reduced the number of actual supercell kpoint needed.
The figure below is a test without any reduction - there were 403 kpoints sampled, while the one used the in comparison above has 135 kpoints, yet it gives identical outputs.

# PyVaspwfc

This is a python class for dealing with `VASP` pseudo-wavefunction file `WAVECAR`.
It can be used to extract the planewave coefficients of any single Kohn-Sham (KS)
orbital from the file.  In addition, by padding the planewave coefficients to a
3D grid and performing 3D Fourier Transform, the pseudo-wavefunction in real
space can also be obtained and saved to file that can be viewed with `VESTA`.

## Transition dipole moment

With the knowledge of the planewave coefficients of the
pseudo-wavefunction,
[transition dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_dipole_moment) between
any two KS states can also be calculated.

## Inverse Participation Ratio
IPR is a measure of the localization of Kohn-Sham states. For a particular KS
state \phi_j, it is defined as

```latex
                \sum_n |\phi_j(n)|^4
IPR(\phi_j) = -------------------------
              |\sum_n |\phi_j(n)|^2||^2
```

where n iters over the number of grid points.

## Electron Localization Function
(Still need to be tested!)

In quantum chemistry, the electron localization function (ELF) is a measure of
the likelihood of finding an electron in the neighborhood space of a reference
electron located at a given point and with the same spin. Physically, this
measures the extent of spatial localization of the reference electron and
provides a method for the mapping of electron pair probability in
multielectronic systems. (from wiki)

NOTE that if you are using VESTA to view the resulting ELF file, please rename
the output file as "ELFCAR", otherwise there will be some error in the
isosurface plot!  When VESTA read in CHG*/PARCHG/*.vasp to visualize isosurfaces
and sections, data values are divided by volume in the unit of bohr^3.  The unit
of charge densities input by VESTA is, therefore, bohr^âˆ’3.  For LOCPOT/ELFCAR
files, volume data are kept intact.

## Band unfolding

Using the pseudo-wavefunction from supercell calculation, it is possible to
perform electronic band structure unfolding to obtain the effective band
structure. For more information, please refer to the following article and the
[GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/tutorials/unfold/unfold.html) website.

# Examples

## Pseudowavefunction in real space

 1. Write a simple script and choose whichever state you like.

```python
from vaspwfc import vaspwfc

wav = vaspwfc('./examples/wfc_r/WAVECAR')
# KS orbital in real space, double the size of the FT grid
phi = wav.wfc_r(ikpt=2, iband=27, ngrid=wav._ngrid * 2)
# Save the orbital into files. Since the wavefunction consist of complex
# numbers, the real and imaginary part are saved separately.
wav.save2vesta(phi, poscar='./examples/wfc_r/POSCAR')

# for WAVECAR from a noncollinear run, the wavefunction at each k-piont/band is
# a two component spinor. Turn on the lsorbit flag when reading WAVECAr.
xx = vaspwfc('examples/wfc_r/wavecar_mose2-wse2', lsorbit=True)
phi_spinor = xx.wfc_r(1, 1, 36, ngrid=xx._ngrid*2)
for ii in range(2):
    phi = phi_spinor[ii]
    prefix = 'spinor_{:02d}'.format(ii)
    xx.save2vesta(phi, prefix=prefix,
            poscar='examples/wfc_r/poscar_mose2-wse2')
```

Below are the real (left) and imaginary (right) part of the selected KS orbital:

2. Or you can also use the script `wfcplot`  in the `scripts` folder

```bash
$ wfcplot -w WAVECAR -p POSCAR -s spin_index -k kpoint_index -n band_index      # for normal WAVECAR
$ wfcplot -w WAVECAR -p POSCAR -s spin_index -k kpoint_index -n band_index  -lgamma    # for gamma-only WAVECAR
$ wfcplot -w WAVECAR -p POSCAR -s spin_index -k kpoint_index -n band_index  -lgamma    # for noncollinear WAVECAR
```
Please refer to `wfcplot -h` for more information of the usage.


## Electron Localization Function
```python
import numpy as np
from vaspwfc import vaspwfc, save2vesta

kptw = [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 12, 12, 12, 6, 6, 12, 12, 6, 6]

wfc = vaspwfc('./WAVECAR')
# chi = wfc.elf(kptw=kptw, ngrid=wfc._ngrid * 2)
chi = wfc.elf(kptw=kptw, ngrid=[20, 20, 150])
save2vesta(chi[0], lreal=True, poscar='POSCAR', prefix='elf')
```
**Remember to rename the output file "elf_r.vasp" as "ELFCAR"!**
## Band unfolding

Here, we use MoS2 as an example to illustrate the procedures of band unfolding.
Below is the band structure of MoS2 using a primitive cell. The calculation was
performed with `VASP` and the input files can be found in the
`examples/unfold/primitive`

![band_primitive_cell](examples/unfold/primitive/band/band_p.png)

1. Create the supercell from the primitive cell, in my case, the supercell is of
   the size 3x3x1, which means that the transformation matrix between supercell
   and primitive cell is
   ```python
    # The tranformation matrix between supercell and primitive cell.
    M = [[3.0, 0.0, 0.0],
         [0.0, 3.0, 0.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
   ```
2. In the second step, generate band path in the primitive Brillouin Zone (PBZ)
   and find the correspondig K points of the supercell BZ (SBZ) onto which they
   fold.

    ```python
    from unfold import make_kpath, removeDuplicateKpoints, find_K_from_k

    # high-symmetry point of a Hexagonal BZ in fractional coordinate
    kpts = [[0.0, 0.5, 0.0],            # M
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],            # G
            [1./3, 1./3, 0.0],          # K
            [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]]            # M
    # create band path from the high-symmetry points, 30 points inbetween each pair
    # of high-symmetry points
    kpath = make_kpath(kpts, nseg=30)
    K_in_sup = []
    for kk in kpath:
        kg, g = find_K_from_k(kk, M)
        K_in_sup.append(kg)
    # remove the duplicate K-points
    reducedK, kid = removeDuplicateKpoints(K_in_sup, return_map=True)

    # save to VASP KPOINTS
    save2VaspKPOINTS(reducedK)
    ```
3. Do one non-SCF calculation of the supercell using the folded K-points and
   obtain the corresponding pseudo-wavefunction. The input files are in
   `examples/unfold/sup_3x3x1/`. The effective band structure (EBS) and
   then be obtained by processing the WAVECAR file.

   ```python
   from unfold import unfold

   # basis vector of the primitive cell
   cell = [[ 3.1850, 0.0000000000000000,  0.0],
           [-1.5925, 2.7582909110534373,  0.0],
           [ 0.0000, 0.0000000000000000, 35.0]]

   WaveSuper = unfold(M=M, wavecar='WAVECAR')

   from unfold import EBS_scatter
   sw = WaveSuper.spectral_weight(kpath)
   # show the effective band structure with scatter
   EBS_scatter(kpath, cell, sw, nseg=30, eref=-4.01,
           ylim=(-3, 4),
           factor=5)

   from unfold import EBS_cmaps
   e0, sf = WaveSuper.spectral_function(nedos=4000)
   # or show the effective band structure with colormap
   EBS_cmaps(kpath, cell, e0, sf, nseg=30, eref=-4.01,
           show=False,
           ylim=(-3, 4))
   ```

   The EBS from a 3x3x1 supercell calculation are shown below:

   ![real part](./examples/unfold/sup_3x3x1/ebs_s_resize.png) |
   ![imaginary part](./examples/unfold/sup_3x3x1/ebs_c_resize.png)

   Another example of EBS from a 3x3x1 supercell calculation, where we introduce a
   `S` vacancy in the structure.

   ![real part](./examples/unfold/sup_3x3x1_defect/ebs_s_resize.png) |
   ![imaginary part](./examples/unfold/sup_3x3x1_defect/ebs_c_resize.png)

   Yet another band unfolding example from a tetragonal 3x3x1 supercell
   calculation, where the transformation matrix is

   ```python
    M = [[3.0, 0.0, 0.0],
         [3.0, 6.0, 0.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
   ```
   ![real part](./examples/unfold/tet_3x3x1/ebs_s_resize.png) |
   ![imaginary part](./examples/unfold/tet_3x3x1/ebs_c_resize.png)

   Compared to the band structure of the primitive cell, there are some empty
   states at the top of figure. This is due to a too small value of `NBANDS` in
   supercell non-scf calculation, and thus those states are not included.

### Band unfolding wth atomic contributions

After band unfolding, we can also superimpose the atomic contribution of each KS
states on the spectral weight. Below is the resulting unfolded band structure of
Ce-doped bilayer-MoS2. Refer to
`./examples/unfold/Ce@BL-MoS2_3x3x1/plt_unf.py` for the entire code.

   ![imaginary part](./examples/unfold/Ce@BL-MoS2_3x3x1/ebs_s_small.png)

## Band re-ordering

Band re-ordering is possible by maximizing the overlap between nerghbouring
k-points. The overlap is defined as the inner product of the periodic part of
the Bloch wavefunctions.

                        `< u(n, k) | u(m, k-1) >`

Note, however, the `WAVECAR` only contains the pseudo-wavefunction, and thus the
pseudo `u(n,k)` are used in this function. Moreover, since the number of
planewaves for each k-points are different, the inner product is performed in
real space.

The overlap maximalization procedure is as follows:
1. Pick out those bands with large overlap (> olap_cut).
2. Assign those un-picked bands by maximizing the overlap.

An example band structure re-ordering is performed in MoS2. The result is shown
in the following image, where the left/right panel shows the
un-ordered/re-ordered band structure.
